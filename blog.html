    <p class="DPT-text">Desktop publishing is the job of making publications such as books, magazines, newspapers and brochures ready for printing or publication in a computer-aided manner.
        The text and images in the documents are edited and made ready for printing with using appropriate computer software programs such as Adobe Indesign, Illustrator, FrameMaker, QuarkXPress.
        
        </p>
        <p class="DPT-text">While providing desktop publishing service, editing should be regulated in accordance to the language of the document and the patterns of that language. Texts are formatted in a variety of ways, including formatting pages and paragraphs, scaling photos and graphics and arranging them appropriately, building indexes and listings, producing various alphabetical orders, and delivering the document in the desired format and form.</p>
    
<h3 class="h3-blogtitle"> Advantages of DTP </h3>
<p class="DPT-text"> Every language has its own rules and patterns. Sometimes, texts translated from one language to another language increase the number of words due to the different structures of the languages, graphics and diagrams are distorted due to the word length, and the translated text moves away from the original text. DTP service is a very advantageous service to prevent such disruptions.</p>
    
<p class="DPT-text"> Sometimes, the documents can be difficult to translate for a single translator due to the number of pages and the volume of the project. The DTP service completes the translation process earlier and more consistently, using different software and communication tools, with a team that has mastered in the subject.</p>
<p class="DPT-text"> Desktop Publishing also helps you to follow the problems that occur after the translation process, determines the inconsistencies or deficiencies in the translated document and fixes it. In other words, it offers you an opportunity to control the entire process, starting from the initial to the final stage.</p>
<p class="DPT-text">DTP service saves you a great deal of time, effort and printing material with using today’s technology.</p>

<h3 class="h3-blogtitle"> Why DTP is important in the sector of translation? </h3>
<p class="DPT-text"> DTP service has a great importance in the translation industry. DTP service provides services such as fixing the problems that occur in translated documents and controlling the whole process while they are ready for printing. That’s why translation agencies consult to DTP service to get translated projects digitally and ready for printing.</p>
    
<p class="DPT-text last"> The biggest advantages of DTP are; easy job follow-up, completed and ready-to-print project delivery to translation offices. After the translation process is done by the translation offices, making use of the DTP service without having to deal with the visual part of the project and making it ready for printing will save them a lot of time and lighten their workload.
