All written sources such as documents, contracts, agreements, literary texts, correspondence, e-mails are types of written translations. Communication between individuals, societies and organizations can be achieved by using written translations. Written translations play an important role in the introduction of companies to the outside world, the announcement of activities in the digital environment to the world, reporting and being able to follow the world agenda within the scope of international trade. The level of education and specialization of translators are very important for a healthy and easy communication.
